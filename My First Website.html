    <h1>The Story Of Gates</h1>
    <h2>And How <strong>He Conquered</strong> The World</h2>
    <p>The moon was full and bright and seemed close enough to touch, making the night as clear as day. He liked the way the light of it danced off his broken and sweat soaked armor.
        Even though he had just been through the fiercest battle he had ever lived through, he couldn't help but smile. As he stepped through the doorway of the hut into the warm spring night,
        his legs shook but stayed sturdy. Glancing back over his shoulder at the three motionless figures that lay as still as shadows in the night, breathing heavy and staring back at him in a lust filled rage.
