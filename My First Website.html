    <p>Every Once In A While, <strong><em>Something Amazing Happens</em></strong>, and Here I Am</p>
    <h1>The Story Of Gates</h1>
    <h2>And How <strong>He Conquered</strong> The World</h2>
    <p>The moon was full and bright and seemed close enough to touch, making the night as clear as day. He liked the way the light of it danced off his broken and sweat soaked armor.
        Even though he had just been through the fiercest battle he had ever lived through, he couldn't help but smile. As he stepped through the doorway of the hut into the warm spring night,
        his legs shook but stayed sturdy. Glancing back over his shoulder at the three motionless figures that lay as still as shadows in the night, breathing heavy and staring back at him in a lust filled rage.
       <p>The "fiercest", he thought to himself mockingly. With a nice long spear thrust into them, they melt in the middle like all the others. All cockiness aside, he <em>had</em> faced the fiercest warriors in the world,
        and these three were indeed the deadliest. He took another look over his shoulder, at them, <strong>The Three Wives</strong>, completely subdued and completely satiated, for now.

    <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sssniperwolf">The Princess</a> rolled over onto her back her stomach, exposing her smooth bare cheeks to the night.
    The sudden movement made him clutch the <em>Horn Of Schism</em> in anticipation. Nothing. When <a href="https://www.instagram.com/missbrisolo">The She Wolf</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bluehorizonzz">The Blue Bunni</a> slid into each others arms and closed their eyes,
    he knew for sure. The night was his. The beasts had been slain. <strong>The Three Wives</strong>.</p>
